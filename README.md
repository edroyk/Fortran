# Fortran
Consider an experimental setup consisting of a tube filled with air and closed at  one end. A vibrating source, such as a tuning fork, is placed near the open end  of the tube, generating sound waves. When the frequency of the sound matches  the natural frequency of the tube, standing waves are formed inside the tube.
